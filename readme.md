# ArkaClone

ArkaClone is a lose clone of arkanoid and created in LibGDX as a portfolio piece. While still trying to get this to look good the emphasis is laid on good and clean code.

## Getting it to run

It is a gradle based project, so just clone it and import as a gradle project in your favorite Java IDE like Intellij or Eclipse. Gradle will download and build the complete project for you.

Lose assets not provided, keep the PackImages() call in DesktopLauncher commented out as it packs the already provided images from that missing folder.

### My Setup

Android Studio 4.0.1<br/>
Gradle version: 6.1.1<br/>
libGDX 1.9.10<br/>
